<H1><FONT SIZE=4>The Truth About Christianity</FONT></H1>
God is real, and I can prove it.

<H2><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="apostle_martyrdom">
Apostle Martyrdom</A></FONT></H2>
Why did the apostles
invent a story and then willingly die
for it? If it was one guy, then I'd
assume he was crazy, but many?<P>

They died for something they saw and
believed in.

<H2><FONT SIZE=3>Criterion of Embarassment</FONT></H2>
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criterion_of_embarrassment"
TITLE="Criterion of Embarassment">That</A>
is a criterion used to determine
whether something in the New Testament
is true.<P>

It's that, if the event is
embarrassing, it must be true because
<Q CITE="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criterion_of_embarrassment">
the author would have no reason to
invent a historical account which
might embarrass them.</Q>
<SUP><A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criterion_of_embarrassment">[1]</A></SUP><P>

Ironically, it is used by secular
scholars to determine which
<EM>certain</EM> parts of the NT
are true, such as the <A HREF="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/kjv/kjv-idx?type=citation&book=Matthew&chapno=3&startverse=13&endverse=17">
baptism</A> and the <A HREF="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/kjv/kjv-idx?type=DIV2&byte=4510062">
crucifixion</A>, which are deemed
"embarassing".<P>

I argue that it proves the <EM>entire</EM>
NT to be true, for I pose this
question:<CENTER>
<STRONG>Why would they insert
truth amidst a fabrication?</STRONG></CENTER><P>

That is, if they apostles made up the
gospel (they didn't, see <A HREF="#apostle_martyrdom">
Apostle Martyrdom</A>), why would they
insert truth within it? I would just
say he baptized himself with water from
the waterfalls of heaven, and that he
swapped his soul for that of Satan's
so Satan would be crucified and He
would watch, checkmate. But no, they
wrote the <STRONG>truth.</STRONG>

<H2><FONT SIZE=3>Obvious One</FONT></H2>
How was the world made out of a huge
explosion out of nowhere? It's nonsense
when you read about it. A big explosion
arose from nothing and then the world
went into multiple stages of formation
until there was something.

<H2><FONT SIZE=3>Mutations & Evolution</FONT></H2>
For evolution to happen, there must be
mutations, the benficial ones which
survive, the others which are killed by
natural selection.<P>

Mutations are very rare and of negative
nature. Not only that, human DNA has
the capability of correcting many of
these mutations.<P>

Why is incest genetically bad? The
children are born with all sorts of
defects and deformities. Why? They
accumulate more mutations through
inbreeding. Mutations are of negative
nature.<P>

Speaking on the mutation-correcting
capabilities found in human DNA, why do
we have that? I thought that's how
evolutions came about. How is natural
selection going to pick the beneficial
mutations (i.e. evolution) now?

<BLOCKQUOTE CITE="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution#Mutation">
Mutations ... are <STRONG>the ultimate
source of genetic variation in all
organisms.</STRONG>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
(so why get rid of it?)
<P ALIGN="right">- <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution#Mutation">
Wikipedia</A><P>

Also, we share a lot of common DNA with
monkeys, but that's because we both
eat, reproduce, feel disgust, etc. so
of course we're going to have similar
DNA.<P>

Let me ask another question: <A HREF="https://jesus-is-savior.com/Evolution%20Hoax/giraffes.htm" REL="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">
giraffes</A>. Evolution claims giraffes
grew longer necks over the course of
time. How did giraffes get their food
before that, then? They must've. But
then they <EM>didn't</EM> need longer
necks. <A HREF="https://jesus-is-savior.com/Evolution%20Hoax/giraffes.htm" REL="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">
Did they climb trees?</A><P>

Also, if giraffes needed long necks to
get their food, what about the other
animals? How come <EM>they</EM> don't
have long necks?<P>

And how did these rare, random
mutations create such complex
structures such as the eyeball?<P>

And how did conciousness come to be?
From chemicals in the brain? Imagine
that! A cell mutates into existence and
there is a randomness factor to its
genes. As it reproduces it creates
brains, eyeballs, consciousness,
reasoning, reproduction, eggs, mammary
glands, etc. which then creates,
destroys, learns, etc. What hath
mutations wrought? Nay, what hath God
wrought!</P>
