The Truth About Pornography
</FONT></H1>

<H2><FONT SIZE=3>
Pornography: the Addictive Drug
</FONT></H2>
Pornography is like a drug, because
like drugs, pornogarphy creates
dopamine rushes. Dopamine creates
addiction.<P>

Also, dopamine receptors become
desensitized with great dopamine
rushes. Wherefore with drugs, the
addict needs to increase dozage to get
the same sensation (dopamine) as
before. Wherefore you get BDSM, weird
positions and other intense
pornography.<P>

Porn desensitizes dopamine receptors,
 wherefore <A HREF="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/understanding-addiction/202202/what-know-about-adolescent-pornography-exposure">
porn quantity or intensity must
increase</A> to get the same sensation
as before.<P>

Another deplorable aspect is the <A HREF="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/understanding-addiction/202202/what-know-about-adolescent-pornography-exposure">
age of first exposure</A>, between 11
and 12. Here is a quote from
Andrew Anglin:

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="maroon">
Imagine if someone injected you [an 11
year old] with heroin, without your
consent. You would feel great, because
like masturbation, heroin dumps
dopamine into your brain. Also like
masturbation, heroin is extremely
addictive. Then imagine that the person
who injected you told you you could
have unlimited amounts of heroin, for
the rest of your life, in exchange for
watching advertisements or paying
$19.99 per month.

Pornography: The Health Crisis

Masturbation decreases semen and sperm
levels (obviously). This and other

testosterone levels worldwide by

Pornography: the Attack on Your Soul
</FONT></H2>

Pornography is an attack on your soul.
The more you watch it, the less likely
you are to believe in God.<P>

Samuel Perry of the University of
Oklahoma and George Hayward of the
University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill conducted a study on this.<P>

Here is the abstract:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Pornography has become increasingly accessible in the United States, and particularly for younger Americans. While some research considers how pornography use affects the sexual and psychological health of adolescents and emerging adults, sociologists have given little attention to how viewing pornography may shape young Americans’ connection to key social and cultural institutions, like religion. This article examines whether viewing pornography may actually have a secularizing effect, reducing young Americans’ personal religiosity over time. To test for this, we use data from three waves of the National Study of Youth and Religion. Fixed-effects regression models show that more frequent pornography viewing diminishes religious service attendance, importance of religious faith, prayer frequency, and perceived closeness to God, while increasing religious doubts. These effects hold regardless of gender. The effects of viewing pornography on importance of faith, closeness to God, and religious doubts are stronger for teenagers compared to emerging adults. In light of the rapidly growing availability and acceptance of pornography for young Americans, our findings suggest that scholars must consider how increasingly pervasive pornography consumption may shape both the religious lives of young adults and also the future landscape of American religion more broadly.

This is an attack against God and
Christianity. Jews started making
pornography to pervert society
as an attack on Christianity (see
<A HREF="#jews">Pornography: The Jewish
Conspiracy Against God</A>), and this
Jewish enterprise has diminished
belief in God.<P>

Here's a quote from <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Goldstein">
Al Goldstein</A>, Jew known for helping
normalize hardcore pornography in the
United States.

<BLOCKQUOTE CITE="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Goldstein#Views_on_religion">
<FONT COLOR="maroon" STYLE="color:red"><P>

...Ford asked Goldstein why
<STRONG>Jews were dramatically
overrepresented</STRONG> in the
porn industry. He answered, "The only
reason that Jews are in pornography is
that
<STRONG>we think that Christ sucks.</STRONG>
Catholicism sucks. We don't believe in
authoritarianism. Pornography thus
becomes a way of
<STRONG>defiling Christian culture</STRONG>
and, as it penetrates to the
very heart of the American mainstream
(and is no doubt consumed by those
very same WASPs), its subversive
character becomes more charged." ...<P>

Ford also asked, "Do you believe in
God?" Goldstein said, "I believe in me.
I'm God.
<STRONG>Screw God.</STRONG>
God is your need to
believe in some super being. I am the
super being. I am your God, admit it.
We're random. We're the flea on the
butt of the dog." <SUP><A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Goldstein#cite_note-34">
